### Overview of Science ASimulation

Science ASimulation is an innovative, web-based educational platform designed to revolutionize STEM learning, particularly in biology and chemistry, through immersive virtual simulations. Built on a modern Next.js stack (with TypeScript, React Three Fiber for 3D rendering, and integrations like Mol* for molecular visualization), it serves as a safe, accessible "virtual laboratory" for students, educators, and researchers. Launched in late 2025, it draws inspiration from established tools like PhET Interactive Simulations but extends them with AI-driven personalization, user workspaces, and real-time reaction modeling using libraries like RDKit-js for chemistry and BioPython-inspired biology pathways.

The platform's core mission is to bridge theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice, eliminating barriers like equipment costs, safety risks, or lab access. It's free for basic use (with premium tiers for advanced features via Supabase backend), browser-compatible (no downloads needed), and optimized for schools, universities, and self-learners. As of November 25, 2025, it hosts over 150 simulations, with expansions planned for physics and environmental science. User data is GDPR-compliant, with optional progress syncing via Google or email login.

Key stats (from platform analytics):
- **Users**: 50,000+ active (mostly K-12 and undergrad)
- **Simulations Run**: 1M+ sessions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, multilingual (English, Spanish, French; more in beta)

### All Pages and Navigation Structure
